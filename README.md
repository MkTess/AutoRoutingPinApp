This application is a personal passion project, born from a fascination with the complexities of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design. It's a conceptual tool that mimics the challenges of automatic pin routing on circuit boards, offering a unique blend of problem-solving and creativity. Here's what makes this project special:

Conceptual Board Design: Users can create theoretical board layouts, placing pins and identifying inactive 'Z pins' to be avoided during routing. This feature is inspired by the intricacies of real-world PCB design, but tailored for a more abstract, experimental approach.

Simplified Routing Solver: The solver, while not designed for professional use, offers an engaging way to experiment with automatic routing solutions. It's a playful exploration of the algorithms that might be used in more advanced systems, providing insight into the routing process.

Validation and Experimentation: The app includes a feature to validate the routes, ensuring they meet the set criteria. This adds an educational aspect to the project, allowing users to learn from trial and error.

CSV Board Management: With the ability to load and save board layouts as CSV files, the app encourages experimentation and iteration, making it easy to modify and refine designs.

Interactive Board Editing: Users can interactively add or remove pins, offering a hands-on experience in designing and modifying board layouts, much like a puzzle.

This project is a tribute to the world of PCB design, tailored for enthusiasts who share a similar interest. It's a platform for experimentation, learning, and appreciation of the art and science behind circuit board design, rather than a tool for professional application.
